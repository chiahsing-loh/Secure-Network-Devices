# Secure Network Devices

## Objective

This project aimed to provide hands-on experience securing network devices using Cisco Packet Tracer as a simulation tool. It focused on configuring authentication for routers and switches, implementing DHCP for efficient IP management, and enforcing security measures to protect switch ports from unauthorized access and potential threats. This hands-on project was designed to enhance practical knowledge and strengthen understanding of network security.



### Skills Learned

- Configuring authentication on network devices (routers and switches)
- Implementing DHCP for efficient IP management.
- Securing switch ports to mitigate security threats.
- Utilizing Cisco Packet Tracer for network simulation and troubleshooting.
- Advanced understanding of network security concepts, best practices, and practical applications.


### Tools Used

- Cisco Packet Tracer (Network simulation software).
- Router and Switch configurations (CLI-based security settings)
- Networking protocols (Authentication, DHCP, and security best practices).

<b/r>## Walkthrough

This project will consist of 5 tasks, which are as follows:
1. Create your network topology using Cisco Packet Tracer
2. Apply authentication on the switches in your network topology
3. Apply authentication on the router in your network topology
4. Make different PCs from different VLANs communicate with each other
5. Configure DHCP on your router and secure the ports of the switch from attackers




### Task 1: Create your network topology using Cisco Packet Tracer
We will use Cisco Packet Tracer to design and create a network topology that consists of 2 switches connected with 2 PCs each, as in Figure 1.
